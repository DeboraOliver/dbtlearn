# About it

This project was developed as part of bootcamp. The aim was to learn Analytics Engineering with this dbt through a real-world Airbnb use case. Apart from dbt itself, this project also used: snowflake, dbt-expectations, aws (to keep a file files) and preset to crete a dashboard.

The final files organization (snowflake):

One of the greatest advantages of dbt clearly is its documentation and how easy is to create it:

Also a dashboard was created:
